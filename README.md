# FACULTY-COURSE ALLOTMENT IN UNIVERSITIES USING BIPARTITE GRAPHS

Course Project for CS F222 (Discrete Structures for Computer Science)   

This project is a program to automate allotment of university courses to professors balancing preferences, workload constraints and minimum requirements across multiple degree levels, using bipartite graph optimization with the [NetworkX library](https://networkx.org/) in python.    

The entire code is present in a single notebook, [here](https://github.com/RishabhKhandelwal-17/faculty-course-allotment-automation/blob/main/allotment%20automater.ipynb).

The cells should preferably be run one cell at a time but can be run all at once also. However, if run all at once, and a crash message is displayed, then the output from any cell beneath the cell that displays the crash message, is garbage and is to be ignored.

When testing different input files, the file name and path must be changed in the code directly. 

The [test case inputs](https://github.com/RishabhKhandelwal-17/faculty-course-allotment-automation/tree/main/input%20test%20cases) are also included in the repository.
The output files ‘faculty course allotment 1’ and faculty course allotment 2’ which are created for the test case file ‘testdata_5’ are also included in the [sample outputs folder](https://github.com/RishabhKhandelwal-17/faculty-course-allotment-automation/tree/main/sample%20outputs)

Most of the methodology and thought process is explained in the [report](https://github.com/RishabhKhandelwal-17/faculty-course-allotment-automation/blob/main/project%20report.pdf) as well as comments and markdown in the jupyter notebook itself.
